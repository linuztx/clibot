> [!TIP]
> You can use locally hosted open source models which are available for free. To use local models, you will need to run your own LLM backend server such as [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama).
>
> **‚ùóÔ∏èNote: Locally hosted models require high-end hardware for optimal performance and may not work as expected on lower-end systems.**

## Upcoming Features: Agentic Capabilities

I'm excited to announce that in upcoming updates, Clibot will be enhanced with agentic capabilities, taking its functionality to the next level:

- ü§ñ **Autonomous Task Execution**: Clibot will be able to break down complex tasks into smaller steps and execute them autonomously.
- üîÑ **Adaptive Decision Making**: The AI will make decisions based on the current context and previous interactions, adapting its approach as needed.
- üîç **Proactive Information Gathering**: Clibot will actively seek out additional information when necessary to complete tasks more effectively.
- üéØ **Goal-Oriented Behavior**: Users will be able to set high-level goals, and Clibot will work towards achieving them independently.
- üß† **Enhanced Problem Solving**: The AI will utilize its expanded capabilities to tackle more complex problems and provide more comprehensive solutions.

These agentic features will make Clibot an even more powerful assistant, capable of handling a wider range of tasks with increased autonomy and intelligence. Stay tuned for updates!
