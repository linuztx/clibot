> You can use locally hosted open source models which are available for free. To use local models, you will need to run your own LLM backend server such as [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama).
>
> **❗️Note: Localhosted models require high-end hardware for optimal performance and may not work as expected on lower-end systems.**
